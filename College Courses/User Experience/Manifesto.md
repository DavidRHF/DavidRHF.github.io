# User Experience Manifesto
### Introduction:
Within every created website, device, and application, many methods are involved before the end design goal. Design methods are important because they provide a structured and systematic approach to solving problems. By following processes such as research, prototyping, and testing, designers can make proper decisions rather than relying on guesswork. These methods are used to help identify user needs, technical constraints, and potential risks early in the process. This leads to a reduction in costly errors and redesigns later in the process. Design methods rely on collaboration and clear communication so that designers and stakeholders can always be on the same page.
During the User Experience course, we learned many different methods pertaining to the philosophy of design. Over the course of the semester, we redesigned applications, designed our own applications, and visualized data. Without design methods to aid me, these projects would have been a difficult process. In this manifesto, I will review 5 of the most important methods that I used for designing and why they’re so important. 

### Prototyping 
Prototyping is an effective design method because it turns ideas into visible and testable forms that reveal how a design would work in practice. By interacting with a prototype, designers can identify usability issues, and design flaws early. It is important to catch them early since changes are easier and less costly to make. Prototyping also involves iteration and clear communication. This allows designers to base their ideas on real user feedback and align stakeholders with the hypothetical design.
Prototyping has helped me in almost every assignment I’ve done for this class since it allows ideas to flow and helps with my visualization. A project that really benefitted from prototyping was our design for understanding project. This project involved finding a dataset and representing that data using charts. Early in the process we used a 5-step method of prototyping called the fdS approach. The 5 steps were idea making, filtering, categorizing, refining, and summarizing/questions.

For this specific lab, I compared misinformation in AI chat bots. This chart helped me steadily realize what designs I wanted to go with for my graphs. Eventually, we moved onto larger prototypes. While still on paper, they were more complete than the past design sheet.

** Fleshed out prototype **
This is an example of one of the graphs prototypes I envisioned. It shows the separate platforms graphs, the possible buttons involved, and the graph key. After getting a concrete idea of what I wanted this to look like, I used  Tableau to bring it to life.

** Completed graph **
This graph shows the combination of all platforms and the number of entries compared to the months it occurred. Overall, this lab took many steps in the prototyping process. Although it seems like a lot, it was necessary to find a direction that works best.
